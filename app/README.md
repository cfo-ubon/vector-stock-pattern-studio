# Vector Stock Pattern Studio (React app)

A client-only React + TypeScript + Vite app that generates seamless,
fully-editable SVG surface patterns for stock sites (Adobe Stock,
Shutterstock, Freepik, Creative Fabrica, ...). Everything is procedural —
no AI image API calls, no backend, no per-generation cost.

This app lives alongside the original static-site prototype in the repo
root (`/index.html`, `/js`, `/css`); the two are independent and this one
does not replace it.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # type-check + production build to dist/
npm run lint
```

## How a pattern is built

1. A **layout** (`src/layouts/*`) decides where motifs go inside one square
   tile — grid, brick/offset, half-drop, radial/mandala, or random scatter.
2. A **generator** (`src/generators/*`) supplies the actual shape for each
   placement — currently Geometric, Botanical/Floral, Abstract Organic,
   Tropical, Boho/Tribal, Line Art, Mandala, Textile/Damask, and Cute/Kids.
   Each call returns one randomly-varied motif from that category's pool.
3. The **engine** (`src/engine/tile.ts`) combines the two: for every
   placement it draws the motif not just once but at every periodic offset
   `(x ± tileSize, y ± tileSize)` that could overlap the tile edge, then
   clips the whole layer to the tile rectangle. Because the underlying
   placements are periodic, this guarantees the tile is seamless — a motif
   that overhangs the right edge reappears correctly cut off on the left.
4. The result is a plain **SVG AST** (`src/engine/svgAst.ts`, a small
   `{tag, attrs, children}` tree) — not markup strings — serialized once by
   `serialize()`. Preview and export both consume the exact same tree, so
   what you see on screen is guaranteed to match what gets exported.

## Export

- **Single tile** (`Export single tile`): one `<svg>` sized exactly to the
  tile, ready to drop into a repeat/pattern fill.
- **Pre-tiled 3×3** (`Export 3x3 tiled`): nine literal, independently
  editable copies of the tile (not `<use>` references) laid out edge to
  edge, useful for previewing/selling a bigger swatch.

Both exports use only SVG 1.1 primitives (`path`, `circle`, `rect`,
`polygon`, `line`, `g`, `clipPath`) with plain `fill`/`stroke`/`transform`
attributes — no CSS filters or classes — so they open cleanly in Affinity
Designer 2 with real, separately-selectable groups (`layer-background`,
`layer-pattern`, `motif-1`, `motif-2`, ...).

## Adding a new pattern category

Implement the `PatternGenerator` interface in a new file under
`src/generators/` (see `geometric.ts` for the smallest example) and add it
to the registry in `src/generators/index.ts`. Nothing in the engine,
layouts, or UI needs to change — the control panel picks up new categories
automatically. The remaining category from the original brief
(Seasonal/Holiday) is not implemented yet; this is where to add it.

## Adding a new layout

Implement the `PatternLayout` interface under `src/layouts/` (returns an
array of `{x, y, rotationDeg, scale, colorSeed}` placements given tile size/
density/jitter params) and register it in `src/layouts/index.ts`.
